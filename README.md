# The Mango Nerd Sample Site Project!
Welcome to my first real public repo! This is for anyone looking to get into Next.js, GraphQl in React and using Wordpress headless!

### Tech Used with Links

- Next.js [Getting Started](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started)
- Apollo GraphQl for React [Getting Started](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
- Express
- Wordpress Plugins
  - Advanced Custom Fields Pro (Add Yourself - this is a must have for any wordpress dev)
  - CPT UI
  - The SEO Framework
  - WPGraphQl [Docs](https://docs.wpgraphql.com/) | [Playground](https://playground.wpgraphql.com/#/) (Honestly more useful than the docs right now)
  - WPGraphiQl (An interface to try out your queries!)

### Other Tools Needed
- Docker (If you're on windows then you must upgrade to Windows 10 Pro)
- Node.js 5 or higher
